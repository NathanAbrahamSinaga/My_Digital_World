Talk to your parents, your friends, or anyone you trust. You're not alone, and you don’t have to face it all by yourself.\n\nPlease, don’t turn to things like porn or harmful distractions, it won’t make the pain go away; it only makes things worse.\n\nHold on to what truly matters to you. Even if you feel like no one cares, even if you think God has forgotten you, He hasn’t. He’s still there.\n\nYou are not hopeless. You are worth helping.",

But for me, I’m starting to lose interest in the things I used to enjoy. I don’t get excited about stuff like I did when I was a kid...\n\nMaybe it’s just part of growing up...\n\nI don’t know, man. I’m scared of the future. MY DUMB FUCKING BRAIN STILL HOPES I’ll randomly meet a girl who’ll somehow save me, bring color back into my life, make me happy. Someone I can protect too and we’d just get through life together",
