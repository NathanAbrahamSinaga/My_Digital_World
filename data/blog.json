    "isi": "Sometimes, when we feel really sad, we might think we’re depressed. But remember, only a professional can truly diagnose depression. If you're struggling, please seek help. Talk to your parents, your friends, or anyone you trust. You're not alone, and you don’t have to face it all by yourself.\n\nPlease, don’t turn to things like porn or harmful distractions—it won’t make the pain go away; it only makes things worse.\n\nHold on to what truly matters to you. Even if you feel like no one cares, even if you think God has forgotten you—He hasn’t. He’s still there.\n\nYou are not hopeless. You are worth helping.",
